My semester group project on All Number System Arithmetic Calculator and Converter using C++.
This project contains the menu which allow user to select what they want to do or perform. Below are the things this code can do for user:
 The CALCULATOR can perform:
 ARITHEMETIC OPERATIONS ON DECIMAL NUMBERS
 ARITHEMETIC OPERATIONS ON BINARY NUMBERS
 ARITHEMETIC OPERATIONS ON OCTAL NUMBERS
 ARITHEMETIC OPERATIONS ON HEXADECIMAL NUMBERS
 
 while the CONVERTER can convert:
 DECIMAL NUMBERS TO ANY NUMBER SYSTEM
 BINARY NUMBERS TO ANY NUMBER SYSTEM
 OCTAL NUMBERS TO ANY NUMBER SYSTEM
 HEXADECIMAL NUMBERS TO ANY NUMBER SYSTEM
